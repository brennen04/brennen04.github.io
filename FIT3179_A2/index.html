      The Next Chapter: Jobs, Pay, and Reality After University
    </h1>
    <p>
      In Australia, the transition from university to the workforce is a significant milestone that shapes the future of graduates.
      This visualization explores the relationship between university degrees, employment rates, and average salaries across various 
      fields of study.

        <h2>The Beginning: Graduation Is Only the Start</h2>
        <p>The end of university is the beginning of a bigger journey - one that leads into the workforce.
            But what does that path look like for thousands of Australian graduates every year?
          </p>
        <p>
          Domestic graduates consistently get hired first across all degrees. Pursuing postgraduate coursework or
           research clearly boosts employment outcomes for domestic graduates, helping them secure jobs more easily. 
           For international students, however, only postgraduate research significantly improves employment chances.
           The difference between domestic and international 
           graduates narrows at the research level, showing that highly specialised skills can reduce the impact of
            citizenship status on employment.

        <h2> Degrees That Open Doors: Full-Time Employment After Graduation </h2>
         <p>Some study paths lead straight into the workforce - others require a longer journey. 
          Domestic graduates consistently achieve higher full-time employment across almost all study areas, 
          often by 15-25 percentage points. Healthcare-related degrees perform strongly for both domestic and international
           students, with fields like Medicine, Pharmacy, and Rehabilitation offering reliable job 
           prospects thanks to clear pathways and strong demand. 
           <p>
            For international students, employment is generally lower -
           especially in Communications and Creative Arts , where success relies more on local networks. Still,
            there are bright spots: Dentistry sees international graduates outperform locals (93.3% vs 85.6%), and Tourism &
             Hospitality shows almost no gap (68.5% vs 69.8%). This contrast shows how the field you choose can shape the speed and ease of your transition into the workforce.

        <h2> Jobs: Mapping Australia's Hiring Hotspots </h2>
        <p>Vacancy rates show how many jobs are available compared to the labour force - 
          a higher rate means more job openings per worker, often signalling strong demand or skill shortages. 
          The ACT (5.2%) and Northern Territory (3.8%) lead with the most opportunities, while larger states like 
          NSW (2.1%) and Victoria (1.9%) have tighter, more competitive markets. Nationally, the rate is around 2.5%, 
          or roughly one unfilled job for every 40 workers.

        <h2> Does It Pay Off? Salary, Skills, and Success </h2>
        <p>Domestic students, who are Australian citizens or permanent residents, always have higher 
          median salaries compared to international students regardless the field of study and education level.

        <h2> Does It Pay Off? Postgraduate Study Might Help </h2>
        <p>Higher education often boosts income, but not equally for everyone. Domestic graduates see major gains - from 
          $75K at undergraduate to over $100K after postgraduate study - while international students benefit
           most only through research degrees. This highlights that advanced qualifications pay off, yet returns
            depend on citizenship and study type, reflecting differences in employability and industry pathways.
