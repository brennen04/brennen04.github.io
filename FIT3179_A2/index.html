      <h1>The Next Chapter: Jobs, Pay, and Reality After University</h1>
      <p>
        In Australia, the transition from university to the workforce is a significant milestone that shapes the future of graduates.
        This visualization explores the relationship between university degrees, employment rates, and median salaries across various fields of study and universities.

      <h2>The Beginning: Graduation Is Only the Start</h2>
      <p>
        The end of university marks the beginning of a bigger journey - one that leads into the workforce.
        But what does that path look like for thousands of Australian graduates every year?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Domestic graduates</b> consistently get hired first across all degrees. Pursuing <b>postgraduate coursework</b> or 
        <b>research</b> clearly boosts employment outcomes for domestic graduates, helping them secure jobs more easily. 
        For <b>international students</b>, however, only <b>postgraduate research</b> significantly improves employment chances.
        The difference between domestic and international graduates <b>narrows at the research level</b>, showing that
        <b>highly specialised skills</b> can reduce the impact of citizenship status on employment.

      <h2>Degrees That Open Doors: Full-Time Employment After Graduation</h2>
      <p>
        Some study paths lead straight into the workforce - others require a longer journey. 
        <b>Domestic graduates</b> consistently achieve <b>higher full-time employment</b> across almost all study areas, 
        often by <b>15-25 percentage points</b>. 
        <b>Healthcare-related degrees</b> perform strongly for both groups, with fields like <b>Medicine</b>, <b>Pharmacy</b>, 
        and <b>Rehabilitation</b> offering reliable job prospects thanks to clear pathways and strong demand. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For <b>international graduates</b> international, employment is generally lower - especially in <b>Communications</b> and <b>Creative Arts</b>, 
        where success relies more on local networks. Still, there are bright spots: 
        <b>Dentistry</b> sees international graduates outperform locals (<b>93.3%</b> vs <b>85.6%</b>), and 
        <b>Tourism & Hospitality</b> shows almost no gap (<b>68.5%</b> vs <b>69.8%</b>). 
        This contrast shows how the <b>field you choose</b> can shape the speed and ease of your transition into the workforce.

      <h2>Jobs: Mapping Australia's Hiring Hotspots</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Vacancy rates</b> show how many jobs are available compared to the labour force - 
        a higher rate means more job openings per worker, often signalling strong demand or skill shortages. In 2024, 
        The <b>ACT (5.2%)</b> and <b>Northern Territory (3.8%)</b> lead with the most opportunities, 
        while larger states like <b>NSW (2.1%)</b> and <b>Victoria (1.9%)</b> have tighter, more competitive markets. 
        Nationally, the rate is around <b>2.5%</b> - roughly <b>one unfilled job for every 40 workers</b>.

      <h2>University: Prestigeness, Reality</h2>
      <p>
        In 2024, <b>Domestic graduates</b> generally enjoy <b>higher full-time employment (70-85%)</b> and stronger 
        <b>median salaries ($70k-80k)</b> across most universities.
        However, at <b>Group of Eight (Go8)</b> universities, prestige doesn't always guarantee success - 
        undergraduate and international graduates often record <b>lower employment rates (around 50-65%)</b> 
        and moderate salaries. 
        This highlights a clear <b>citizenship and institutional gap</b>, where <b>local experience</b>, 
        <b>work rights</b>, and <b>regional demand</b> often outweigh university brand in shaping graduate employability.

      <h2>Does It Pay Off? Postgraduate Study Might Help</h2>
      <p>
        Higher education often boosts income - but not equally for everyone. 
        In 2024, <b>Domestic graduates</b> see major gains, jumping from <b>$75K</b> at undergraduate to over <b>$100K</b> after postgraduate study. 
        <b>International students</b> benefit most only through <b>research degrees</b>, highlighting that while 
        <b>advanced qualifications pay off</b>, returns depend on <b>citizenship</b> and <b>study type</b>. 
        This reflects how employability and income growth are tied to <b>industry pathways</b> and <b>work experience</b>.
